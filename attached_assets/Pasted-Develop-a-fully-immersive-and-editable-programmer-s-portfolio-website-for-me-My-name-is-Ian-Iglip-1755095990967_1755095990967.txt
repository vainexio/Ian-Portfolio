Develop a fully immersive and editable programmer’s portfolio website for me.

My name is: Ian Iglipa

Purpose: Showcase my works, achievements, skills, background information, and other portfolio details in a highly unique, visually engaging way.

Design & Branding:

Primary colors: Dark and vibrant, but comfortable on the eyes.

Typography: Clean and easy to read.

Vibe: Playful and immersive.

Style: Glassmorphism and other fitting modern effects.

Dark mode only.

Overlapping elements allowed (e.g., text overlapping images) but maintain readability and design clarity.

Core Features:

Content Management

Store all portfolio content (projects, achievements, skills, background info) in a single JSON file.

Editing, adding, or deleting entries should only require modifying the JSON file.

No admin panel needed — just code-based modification.

Works/Projects Display

Each entry includes a thumbnail image.

Images must align visually regardless of their size, with lazy loading for performance.

Add smooth hover animations for immersive effects.

Use fade effects on images so they blend into the background.

Interactive Design

3D effects for buttons and interactive elements.

Smooth scrolling with section appearance animations and transitions (e.g., fade-in, slide-up when entering viewport).

Include interactive charts for skills (no skill bars).

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Mongoose (MongoDB) to load portfolio data from JSON or DB if needed in the future.
